If you'd like to help out with Hubroid, here's a couple guidelines you should follow:

* Follow all Android Coding Style Guidelines, especially:
    - Spaces, not tabs; Use 4 of them
    - Member names should follow the form of "mVariable", not "m_variable" or "_variable".
* Develop on your fork, then send me a pull request when you're ready for a review
