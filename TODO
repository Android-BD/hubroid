* Commit Overhaul:
	1) Create Commit activity that shows information for a specific commit:
		- Full commit message
		- Author
		- Committer
		- Author/Commit date(s)
		- # of files changed
		- # of files added
		- # of files removed
	2) "# of files X" in above Commit activity links off to list of the files that were changed/added/removed
	3) Clicking a file in one of the above lists would open a refactored diff viewer, this time only showing one file's diff
* Switch to using a WebView to displaying commit diffs (easier to color lines that way)
